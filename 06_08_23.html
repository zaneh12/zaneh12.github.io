									<h2>Thoughts on True interests</h2>
								</header>

								<p>
									But what about Politics. When one says politics as an interest what does that mean? All I am really drawn to is reading articles on Geopolitics... China, UK, USA. What in particularly is that draw? I understand there is no immediate neccessity, per say, in monetizing an interest. But I do wonder the necessity of continuing this phd if I don't have any interst in mathematics or statistics. I just dont... I mean maybe you need to continune doing this until something picks up. Or just use the statistics to be part of somethign else and this is just the sacrafice. Do i need to start making youtube videos or some other thing though? Writing. I don't think that the lessons are particularly appealing like sol does. 
								</p>
								<p>
									If that is the case though... what possibly could I do. Its about time constraints sitting at the desk imo... I think I am worn out before I get to my research. Let's be honest. The research doesn't take that long hahah. Every week I bring in a slight increase in the Dirichlet process
								</p>

								<p>
									I think I was chasing complexity, when complexity was never the true interest. I think people and policy are much more compelling than any of that other shit.
								</p>
								<p>
									Take this further... What would you focus on? You cannot just simple think about exclusively. Things like Oil and Gas, Technology, Industrials, China. China's trade. All sorts of things. But there has to be something that makes you tick. British Politics? Politics specifically?
								</p>
								<p>
									Where is the balance between doing shit you do not want to do vs doing shit you want to do exclusively. That balance. 
								</p>
								<p> 
									I think tobacco, oil and gas, outdoor field stuff. Technology is boring. I think I have always been interested in the concept of oil. I think the counter narrative is compellign to be fair. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Foreign policy seems cool too. But specifically waht. What everyday can you wake up and say I am interested in doing? The oil report. The barrel barrage. I think that could be cool. The trade between UK, US< Europe China russia.
